# Highz-EXP
This is a preliminary version for analyzing data collected from the HighZ-EXP experiment. It includes modules for loading files, processing reflection data, plotting spectra, and converting units.

## Installation

### From GitHub (for Google Colab or local installation)

```python
!pip install git+https://github.com/alhosani-abdulla/Highz-EXP.git
```
Noe that `-e` flat does not work in Google Colab, as it's designed for local dev where changes to the source code is immediately reflected in the installed package without reinstallation. Google Colab does not provide persistent access to the source code.

### For development (editable install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alhosani-abdulla/Highz-EXP.git
cd Highz-EXP
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
# Import the package (note: use underscore, not hyphen)
import highz_exp

# Or import specific modules
from highz_exp import file_load, reflection_proc, spec_plot, unit_convert
```

If run into import issues, try 
```bash
pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/alhosani-abdulla/Highz-EXP.git
```
